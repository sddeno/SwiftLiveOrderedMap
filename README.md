# SwiftLiveOrderedMap

`SwiftLiveOrderedMap` is a high-performance, value-semantic, ordered key-value map for Swift â€” implemented from scratch using an AVL Tree under the hood. It maintains the **insertion order** of keys while supporting **fast lookups**, **removals**, and **ordered iteration**.

This package is the key-value counterpart to [SwiftLiveOrderedSet](https://github.com/sddeno/SwiftLiveOrderedSet), built with the same principles of correctness, efficiency, and expressive Swift API design.
